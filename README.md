# React-Lifecycle Methods


## Initialization

According to the syntax of **React.createClass**, ***getDefaultProps()*** and ***getInitialState*** can be used but the syntax changes when we use **React.Component**.  

##### [The changes (between React.createClass and React.Component) are described here in full detail](https://toddmotto.com/react-create-class-versus-component/)

**prop-types** npm package is used for validating Prop types. You have to first install it using: 

	npm install --save prop-types
